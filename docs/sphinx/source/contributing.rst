Contributing
============

Encouraging more people to help develop pvlib-python is essential to our
success. Therefore, we want to make it easy and rewarding for you to
contribute.


Easy ways to contribute
-----------------------

Here are a few ideas for you can contribute, even if you are new to
pvlib-python, git, or Python:

* Make `GitHub issues <https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues>`_
  and contribute to the conversation about how to resolve them.
* Read issues and pull requests that other people created and
  contribute to the conversation about how to resolve them.
* Improve the documentation and the unit tests.
* Improve the IPython/Jupyter Notebook tutorials or write new ones that
  demonstrate how to use pvlib-python in your area of expertise.
* If you have MATLAB experience, you can help us keep pvlib-python
  up to date with PVLIB_MATLAB or help us develop common unit tests.
  For more, see `Issue #2 <https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues/2>`_
  and `Issue #3 <https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues/3>`_.
* Tell your friends and colleagues about pvlib-python.
* Add your project to our
  `Projects and publications that use pvlib-python wiki
  <https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/wiki/Projects-and-publications-
  that-use-pvlib-python>`_.


How to contribute new code
--------------------------

Contributors to pvlib-python use GitHub's pull requests to add/modify
its source code. The GitHub pull request process can be intimidating for
new users, but you'll find that it becomes straightforward once you use
it a few times. Please let us know if you get stuck at any point in the
process. Here's an outline of the process:

#. Create a GitHub issue and get initial feedback from users and
   maintainers. If the issue is a bug report, please include the
   code needed to reproduce the problem.
#. Obtain the latest version of pvlib-python: Fork the pvlib-python
   project to your GitHub account, ``git clone`` your fork to your computer.
#. Make some or all of your changes/additions and ``git commit`` them to
   your local repository.
#. Share your changes with us via a pull request: ``git push`` your
   local changes to your GitHub fork, then go to GitHub make a pull
   request.

The Pandas project maintains an excellent `contributing page
<https://github.com/pydata/pandas/wiki/Contributing>`_ that goes into
detail on each of these steps. Also see GitHub's `Set Up Git
<https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>`_ and `Using Pull
Requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_.

Note that you do not need to make all of your changes before creating a
pull request. Your pull requests will automatically be updated when you
commit new changes and push them to GitHub. This gives everybody an easy
way to comment on the code and can make the process more efficient.

We strongly recommend using virtual environments for development.
Virtual environments make it trivial to switch between different
versions of software. This `astropy guide
<http://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/workflow/
virtual_pythons.html>`_ is a good reference for virtual environments. If
this is your first pull request, don't worry about using a virtual
environment.

You must include documentation and unit tests for any new or improved
code. We can provide help and advice on this after you start the pull
request.

The maintainers will follow same procedures, rather than making direct
commits to the main repo. Exceptions may be made for extremely minor
changes, such as fixing documentation typos.
